<h1>My interest in IT</h1><hr>
<h2><u>When did my IT interest start?</u></h2>
<p>About one year ago my risk and compliance manager needed someone on our team to learn and maintain our SharePoint Page as she was leaving, this person became me. My risk and compliance manager found I picked up on IT terminology quickly and was able to learn how to use SharePoint the fastest out of all our team members. I enjoyed doing this and found it interesting the way I could create a better system for my team to use to complete the task they need to do efficiently. e.g., client handover centre to retain information that allows us to pull reports for certain things like activity gathering list, individual support list, and more. I do not have any other IT experience besides this.</p>
<h2><u>Why RMIT?</u></h2>
<p>I work full time and with RMIT I don't have to commit to going to face-to-face classroom sessions which would involve travel, I can study after work with the hours RMIT is offering me. I find RMIT flexible and supportive toward the student who is working plus studying e.g., allowing them to watch webinars at a time that suits them, not committed to certain study days we can organise them ourselves. A big thing for me with RMIT is I can do one course at a time so I am not overworked and overstudied, I don't have to travel and without RMIT I would have had to pick between my position as a Wellbeing Coordinator as I need to do 38hours a week to keep this position and studying.</p>
<h2><u>What do you expect to learn?</u></h2>
<ul>
<li>During this course I am hoping to learn about more careers in IT and how to get there.</li>
<li>Understanding the coding languages which this first assessment has been a good beginning, I would like to get better at it and dig deeper into it.</li>
<li>To get an understanding of Cyber and Security</li>
</ul>
