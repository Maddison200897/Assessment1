<h2><u>LEARN TO RECYCLE - APP</u></h2>
<h3>1. Overview</h3>
<p>Recycling, who knows how to do this properly. There are many rules to recycling that we never seem to remember. What if there was an app available at the tip of your fingers to help you, help our planet.</p>
<p>For example, did you know pizza boxes can go in your green bin.</p> 
<p>I would like to develop an easy-to-use app for adults and children to help them understand how to recycle everyday items properly, also with some education about why we do it, why it is important and how to start. I believe if there was an app available to guide people out in the community with recycling and understand it more, we would all start recycling a bit better and a bit more.</p>
<h3>2. Motivation</h3>
<p>The reason I believe this app would be helpful is it is a start to work on something bigger, once doing a recycling app to help others understand the importance of this you can work toward sustainability, compost, and climate change. This app might encourage others to help control landfills and greenhouse gases.</p> 
<p>Waste recycling or reuse activity is important in reducing the impact of human waste on the environment. The more items that are reused and recycled, the less space is needed for landfills and the fewer emissions generated. (Australian Bureau of statistics 2010).</p> 
<p>High levels of methane gas and CO2 are generated by the rotting rubbish in the ground. These are greenhouse gases, which contribute greatly to the process of global warming.</p>
<p>Toxic substances end up in landfills, which leech into the earth and groundwater over time. This creates a huge environmental hazard. Substances include arsenic, mercury, PVC, acids, lead, and home cleaning chemicals. Leachate – the toxic liquid formed when water filters through landfill waste – can easily contaminate our waterways. (Unisan August 26, 2021)</p>


<h3>3.	Description</h3>
<p>Where to begin, research will need to be done to put together a plan on the kinds of information we will want on our app. We can create the following pages to supply easy to access and read information to help people find information on recycling. We can categorise landfill items into Yes (yellow bin) to recycle, No (red bin) landfill with a search bar to make it easier to find. All sections will be plain and simple language, so children can join in with the learning.</p>
<p>Pages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recycling Tips – This area will have handy tips on how to recycle, so you can use them in your everyday life. It will be plain and simple language for parents to use with their children.</li>
<li>What isn’t recycle friendly – This area would be used to show and categorise items that are not ideal to be put in your recycling bin. It will also have a search bar so if you are looking for one item it is easier to find just by typing it in.</li>
<li>What we can put in our yellow bins – This area would be the same as above but to show you what can go in your yellow bin. Some items people put rubbish in their yellow bin, and it is not actual friendly to do so.</li>
<li>This can go in your green bins – This area will be for people to understand that there are more items than just grass clippings that can go into your green bin.</li>
<li>Importance of recycling – this would be an educational section on the home page to draw people in to understand why it is important for us to recycle and how they can get started to help.</li>
<li>What landfill does to our planet – This will be education on what the effects of landfill and not recycling can do to the planet we live on. How it works and how we can control it better.</li>
<li>Climate change – More education on how climate change has been impacted over the years, and what areas of the planet it has impacted.</li>
<li>How to compost – Compost guide on how to start composting and why is it good.</li>
<li>Recycling guide – This area is to put charts and guides to recycling for all to download and use in their home for children to start to help with recycling. Easy to read and understand is key.</li>
</ul>
<p>The app will have a bright and colourful theme to it, to make it inviting. Tabs to take you to the above places so it is easily navigated to get to sections. In the composting tab, I would add a how-to composting video to help understand how to start your own composting at home. It will also have pictures to support each section and to help with visual understanding.</p> 
<p>Once the project is finished, we could build onto it, one idea in mind would be to have a recycling game for children with pictures of everyday rubbish items which they have to categorise into the right bin colour yellow, green or red. This will help them understand how to recycle their everyday rubbish.</p>


<h3>4.	Tools and Technologies</h3>
<p>One issue we will need to look at is understanding how to build an app, we can use the software system XCode to create an app it is only available on Mac. I have found a YouTuber online CodewithChris (CodeWithChris, 2021), who teaches and helps you through this process of creating an app. XCode is a software system that allows you to code and create apps plus try them out on your computer whilst making the app, it has different features to assist you in creating your app as well. Then you upload it to the app store.</p>
<p>An issue is there are other apps out there doing this now but how will mine be different.</p>
<p>I have cross-checked four other apps that are out there with the same idea, some of them don’t have central coast council on their sites, they direct you to drop-off areas to take your recycling which isn’t the audience I am targeting. I want the app to be for an average person who wants to do a bit for the planet but not make it so hard they give up, we have to remember we all have busy lives. Some apps are using cameras to identify items and barcodes which I won’t be doing. One thing all these apps have in common is no education on recycling and what it does for the planet. I think this is very important if you are someone who knows nothing about recycling this will encourage the user to use the app as they will know more about how their part will help the planet, it gives them motivation as they know what they are doing is helping and how it helps.</p>



<h3>5.	Skills Required</h3>
<p>In creating the app, you will need to know and understand how to use XCode, this is why I have referenced CodewithChris to guide us through this and help us understand how to use XCode. You will need to know HTML and CSS language. You will also need to have a creative mind to design the app, in this section I believe I will need support from another team member as I am not a very creative person myself. With creating the game to go onto the app I am unsure on how to do this, this will involve more study and why I suggested adding it at a later point.</p>

<h3>6.	Outcome</h3>
<p>In the end, if we are successful in designing this product, we can upload it to the app store as a free source to use as this will encourage more people to use it. If it costs money, I don’t believe people would be interested in learning.</p>
<p>This will educate people to know more about helping the planet, composting, climate change, and recycling. It will be easier enough for children to understand so we can start educating early, this could make a major impact on the planet. Improving our landfill levels, lowering our greenhouse gas levels, and the more people that do it the big the impact will be. It is easy information at the tip of your finger as researching and trying to understand recycling take time and this stop people from doing, so by bringing all the sources to them in one easy app, our success rate will be higher.</p>
