<h1>Test - http://www.testmycreativity.com/ </h1>
<p>Results- Your creativity score is 49.86</p>
<h1><u>What do the results of these tests mean to you?</u></h1>
<p>That I am not very creative, I have not ever been an artistic person. I will need to put in some extra work when it comes to this side of things during our journey together. I need to be more open and accepting of criticism, learn how to not take things personally, look at it as advice and support in improving myself plus work. I need to be acceptable to change and mindful of others’ ideas, so I don’t only believe my way is the best.</p>
<h1><u>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</u></h1>
<p>Negatively I may be controlling, I might believe my ideas will work the best, I could become emotional if another team member offends me. Criticism and conflict are my weakness, I need to learn to deal with this professional. After doing the test but I am loyal, trustworthy, organised, work well in teams, good at connecting with others, and more. I believe these are good traits to have in a team. I will always be fair with workload; I have good time management and I am natural always organised. If there is one thing my current boss says about me, it is my organisation skills are through the roof.</p>
<h1><u>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</u></h1>
<p>Going into a team I need to be aware of my weaknesses and how to identify them, have strategies to control them e.g., breathing control, positive mantra, and the method I use at work now ‘think then respond not respond then think’. Be open with your team about your weaknesses so all can be respectful to one another and understanding. Use your team to their strengthens, teams will work better if we are all set up to succeed.</p>
