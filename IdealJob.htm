<h1><u>Description of job and what makes it appealing to me.</u></h1>
<h3> This position is going to allow you to work with a team in designing and developing many different kinds of robotics such as industrial robots and sensors, machine vision, AGVs, industrial AI, SRMs, and AMRs, that will be used worldwide if successful in designing them. This job is appealing to me because you will be working with a variety of different robotics which will allow me to learn about a lot more than just one field. They state "take advantage of excellent career opportunities within the global organisation" which allows me to feel I could move up in the company and progress in my career.</h3>
<h1><u>Skills, qualifications, and experience required for the position</u></h1>
<h3>In order to gain this position, I will need to be able to.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Understand C++ and Java.</li>
<li>Have good communication skills.</li>
<li>Have education in programming, high academic achievement within computer science, mechatronics, or electrical engineering.</li>
<li>Be experience in documented coding which is well presented.</li>
<li>Strong skill in designing and able to problem-solve.</li>
</ul>
<h1><u>Skills, qualifications, and experience I have currently</u></h1>
<h3>I have very few skills and a long way to go to achieve this goal. The only experience in IT I have is common knowledge.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Outlook.</li>
<li>Office.</li>
<li>Zoom.</li>
<li>Canva.com</li>
<li>Small parts on SharePoint editing handover centres, exporting information into excel to pull reports/filtering information of clients have in common, designing information systems to support the team to do their job more efficiently.</li>

</ul>
<h1><u>How will I obtain the skills, qualifications, and experience?</u></h1>
<h3>My ideal job would be to work with robotics testing and designing, I know this would take experience and probably more study to get into this field, but this is the pathway I would like to take. I am also interested in, computer service technician, cyber security, and hardware engineer. Coming from a nursing background I would need to start from the beginning, exactly why I am here doing Information of Technology to learn and understand the IT world. After this, I think I would gain a position in the IT industry as doing ‘computer service technician’ to get experience and work towards robotics. I like to know all the basics before trying to commit to something I am not experienced in. I would probably do more education in engineering as well.</h3>
